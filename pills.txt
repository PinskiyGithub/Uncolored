    -Sorry for the inconvenience and for attacking Votsuki. He seemed wrong at first... Never mind.-
Votsuki can't read this, so we can discuss anything...
But you won't be able to answer.
Look, I left some pills, make Votsuki take them.
Your sanity scale is extremely low, if you don't take the pills, then-- It doesn't matter.
The pills restore your sanity and also give you one ability.
Press the "I" button, the world becomes...a little different, then press the "O" button to change it back. 
Some objects are only visible in one of the two worlds.
Good luck.
